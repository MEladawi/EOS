# EOS
EOS is a baby operating system I development back in 2011, during my last year of computer engineering undergrad study. It supports arabic commands, and it has built-in calculator and word editor!

It was a lot of hard work, and of course fun! 

I will add a tutorial on how to build and run it when I come up for air!
