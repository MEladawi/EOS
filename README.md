# EOS
EOS is a baby operating system I development back in 2011, during my last year of computer engineering undergrad study, which was renamed later to Lotus.

It supports arabic commands, and it has built-in calculator and word editor!

It was a lot of hard work, and of course fun, going through every detail and read the chips' manuals (including Intel's IA32 microprocessor software developers manual). 

I still rememebr how happy I was when I changed the mode to 32-bit for the first time, and when I had the keyboard working :)

I will add a tutorial on how to build and run it when I get a chance (haven't done that since 2011)!

Credit goes to my friend Mahmod for writing the code of the editor and calculator.

These are the only screenshots I have from back then.
